        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h4><b>Welcome to Lettuce Eat!</b></h4>
        <p>Let me tell you a little bit about us.</p>
        <p>When my Memaw was in her fifties, she had a love for traveling, discovering new places, and, most of all, sharing good food. In 1964, she moved to Tennessee with a heart full of passion for home-cooked meals made from fresh, wholesome ingredients. At first, she spent her time visiting local homeless shelters, sharing her dishes filled with flavors from all over the country. It wasn’t just about the food—it was about bringing comfort and warmth to those who needed it most.</p>
        <p>Soon, an idea bloomed in her heart. About a year later, she opened Lettuce Eat, a place where good food and good intentions could come together.</p>
        <p>From the very beginning, Memaw cared deeply about her community and the world around her. She believed food should not only nourish the body but also respect the planet. At first, the restaurant served a mix of dishes, but over time, Memaw became more aware of the impact food choices had on both health and the environment. With her passion for fresh, sustainable ingredients, she decided to make a change—transforming Lettuce Eat into a fully vegetarian restaurant.</p>
        <p>But Memaw also knew that if people wanted to enjoy dairy, it had to come from happy, well-cared-for animals. That’s why she partnered with local farms that raise grass-fed cows with the utmost care and respect. Every ingredient on our menu, from our fresh produce to our dairy products, is chosen with love, ensuring it aligns with our values of sustainability and kindness.</p>
        <p>At Lettuce Eat, we continue Memaw’s legacy by offering a unique collection of delicious, wholesome vegetarian dishes. Every meal is crafted with care, using fresh ingredients that are as kind to the earth as they are to your taste buds. Whether you’re a lifelong vegetarian or just looking for a meal that makes you feel good inside and out, we’re here to welcome you with open arms and a warm plate of food.</p>
        <p>So come on in, grab a seat, and enjoy a meal that’s made with love. </p>
